# Touhou Launcher
## A simple application to clean up desktops from too many Marisas
### What is it?
This application serves to conveniently organize Touhou games into one application. With how big the franchise is, I think too many icons on your desktop might be an actual annoyance

### How does it work?
For the time being, I'm making this application for personal use, and the technicalities of it are really suited to what I've got. Later down the road I'll try to make it more general, and I can properly explain how to use it. Until then, TBD.

Just know that all it does is launch your games, and plays the music of some of the games

### Why not use Steam or something?
You totally could. I totally could. But in my case, it's an excuse to not code something

### Special Thanks
- My friend ***NeNikitov***, for helping me code the `MusicFMTData` and `MusicInfo`, as well as explaining to me how to read bytes and make use of them. Check his awesome stuff out [here](https://github.com/nenikitov)
- ***The Touhou Wiki***, for their article on Touhou BGM files
- ***ZUN***, for creating Touhou Project and making music so damn good it made me want to code an entire app on my own accord just to play it
